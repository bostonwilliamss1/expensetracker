# Overview

This is a simple expense tracker. You are able to add what you have spent and what you have earned. There are other features such as deleting a row if you accidentally added information wrong. There is an option to view just what you have spent or just what you have earned. There is also another feature that lets you get the month overview of what you have spent and gets you the average of what you spent everyday. 

My purpose in writing this software was to create something that makes it easy to budget. I like working with my budget but it is such a pain to try to keep track of everything. With this program it makes it easy to keep it all oraganized.

# Relational Database

I am using SQLite for this database. SQLite makes it really simple to use and manipulate data. I really enjoyed using it for this. 

There are two tables, a spending and an income table. I like to keep my income and spending seperate from each other that is why I created two seperate tables. But as they work together you can see how much you are spending versus how much you are gaining. 

# Development Environment

I used Visual Studio code with SQLite import.

I used Python as the programming language with several different libraries. I used datetime, threading, calendar, and prettytable to help view the table.

# Future Work

- I would love to make this is a Web App, maybe next project will be implementing this logic into a Web App
- I would love to create more features for this because there is so many other things you can do with this information, so many different ways to display it.
